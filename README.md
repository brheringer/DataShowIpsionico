# DataShowIpsionico
A very old and simple application used to generate a Power Point presentation based on a bunch of files and premises. It was very helpful for a group of people in a very specific situation for a long time. I admire how a simple software can spare so much time. It depends on Microsoft Office Interop assemblies and may be outdated.
